# Portfolio


## Description
A portfolio of work where you can get in contact, learn about me and view examples of my past work.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.


## Usage
When you use the links in the navigation bar you will be brought to the corresponding are on the website. EX: If you click on the contact link you will be brought to the bottom of the page where there will be a contact form you can fill out to get in touch.

## Support
If in need of assistence please reach out to sophie.g.rankin@gmail.com

## Roadmap
Will be updating this website with work examples and improvments throughout my class.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
